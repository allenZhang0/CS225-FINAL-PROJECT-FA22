# CS225 Final Project FA22: Reddit Community Connections


## [Presentation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_kN8syVgV8)

## Data

We used the [Reddit Hyperlink Network](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html) data set.

## Repo Stucture

The [`/src`](https://github.com/allenZhang0/CS225-FINAL-PROJECT-FA22/tree/main/src) folder contains the code that we used to make our graph along with the algorithms that we used. 

The [`/tests`](https://github.com/allenZhang0/CS225-FINAL-PROJECT-FA22/tree/main/tests) folder contains the datasets that we used to test along with the `tests.cpp` and `catch.hpp` which are the files that we used to test our files.

The [`/lib`](https://github.com/allenZhang0/CS225-FINAL-PROJECT-FA22/tree/main/lib) folder contains the `trimmed.tsv` which is the dataset we trimmed from the original and then used to perform our algorithms on, we weren't able to upload to the original dataset because it was 300 MB, whereas Github's max allowed file size is 100 MB.

## Setup

To run our repository on your own machine, one must first have the environment for UIUC CS225 setup, if you do not have it set up, follow the instructions from [This Guide](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/fa2022/resources/own-machine/)

### Execution
To run out code make sure that you are in `.../CS225-FINAL-PROJECT-FA22` folder, and the type in `make` in the command prompt compile and execute the code

## Code Functionality and Runtimes
To be implemented lol...

## Testing
To run our test cases is similar to running our main. Make sure that you are in `.../CS225-FINAL-PROJECT-FA22` folder, and the type in `make tests` in the command prompt to compile and execute the code
