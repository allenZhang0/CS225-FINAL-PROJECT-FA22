# Team Contract
## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
    We will try our best to meet every other day and discuss recent developments. Each meeting will be around 30 min long or as long as it needs to be for all of us to share all the stuff we want to share. We will primarily try to meet in person, but if we can't make it or don't want to, we will use discord as our primary means of communication. No one individual will take all the notes, but rather we will use a shared google doc to log all of our ideas/fixes/anything. 
2. **Assistance** 
    We are all well connected which means they can either ask through text or through discord when a problem arises and then all team members will try to resolve the issue as soon as possible. It's the goal for everyone to respond to messages as soon as possible, but we will also try to be understanding as we know everyone is busy around this time of the year. 
3. **Respect** 
    In order to promote an environment that facilitates discussion and also brainstorming, we will have each person report on what they have been doing each team meeting and then make sure that everyone has shared what they needed to share. This way, each person's ideas are heard and incorporated into the project. If two ideas clash, then we will try as a team first to reach a compromise. 
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    It's not possible to divide up the work for this project into perfect sections for each team member, so what we will do is first come up with an outline and assign portions based off of each person's strengths and weaknesses. This way each person can be assigned something they know they can do and deliver, and also if someone finishes first, then they should jump to assist the next person to speed up the development process. 
5. **Time Commitment** 
    It's expected each team member spend at least 8 and up to 15 hours per week on this project, although it's totally understandable if they can't since this is the busiest time of the year. This means that this time requirement is extremely flexible and should not be a hard limit or something that you check off. Sometimes, one might work more, and other times, they may work less. 
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    When there's conflict or a disagreement, the conflicting team members should try to resolve it privately first and then if needed, they can call a team meeting to urgently resolve the issue as soon as possible. However, if it does reach the point where the issue is not getting resolved after consistent effort, we will bring it up to our mentor. Respect is key, no one should feel excluded or attacked.
